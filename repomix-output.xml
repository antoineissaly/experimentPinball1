A browser-based pinball game with an 8-bit pixel art style and synthwave aesthetics, where players defend Earth from an alien invasion.

## Project Overview

This game uses a simple tech stack:
- HTML5 Canvas for rendering
- Matter.js for physics
- Vanilla JavaScript for game logic
- Web Audio API for sound (to be implemented)

## Phase 1 Progress: Planning & Design

### Game Concept
- Theme: Defend Earth from alien invasion through pinball gameplay
- Style: 8-bit pixel art with synthwave color palette (purples, pinks, cyans)
- Core mechanics: Standard pinball controls with thematic elements

### Technical Implementation
- Basic project structure created
- HTML canvas setup complete
- Matter.js physics engine integrated
- Basic game loop implemented
- Placeholder pinball elements (walls, ball) created

### Visual Style
- Synthwave color palette defined in CSS:
  - Primary Dark: #120458
  - Primary Purple: #7b2cbf
  - Primary Pink: #e83283
  - Primary Cyan: #43dde6
  - Primary Blue: #0a81d1

## Next Steps (Phase 2)
- Create proper pinball table layout
- Implement flippers physics
- Add alien-themed obstacles and targets
- Design scoring system
- Create visual assets for game elements
