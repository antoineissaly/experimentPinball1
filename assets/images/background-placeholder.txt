ALIEN INVASION PINBALL - BACKGROUND ASSET PLACEHOLDER

This file serves as a placeholder for the background.png asset that will be generated using AI tools.

ASSET DETAILS:
- Filename: background.png
- Description: Pinball table background
- Size: 800x1000 pixels
- Format: PNG

AI GENERATION PROMPT:
"8-bit pixel art pinball table background with space theme, synthwave colors (purple, pink, cyan), stars, and a distant Earth visible at the top. Dark background with grid lines in synthwave style."

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
1. The background should have a dark purple/blue base color (#120458)
2. A grid pattern should extend into the distance, creating a synthwave "outrun" aesthetic
3. The grid lines should be in pink (#e83283) or cyan (#43dde6)
4. Stars of varying sizes should be scattered throughout the background
5. A small Earth should be visible at the top of the image
6. The overall style should be 8-bit pixel art, maintaining a retro arcade feel
7. The image should be designed to fit the pinball table layout, with space for:
   - Flippers at the bottom
   - Bumpers and targets in the middle
   - Special targets and ramps throughout
   - The mothership at the top center

Once generated, this asset will be used in the game.js file to replace the current background implementation:

```javascript
// Create renderer with background image
this.render = Matter.Render.create({
    canvas: this.canvas,
    engine: this.engine,
    options: {
        width: this.width,
        height: this.height,
        wireframes: false,
        background: './assets/images/background.png',
        showAngleIndicator: false
    }
});
