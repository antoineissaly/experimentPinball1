ALIEN INVASION PINBALL - BALL ASSET PLACEHOLDER

This file serves as a placeholder for the ball.png asset that will be generated using AI tools.

ASSET DETAILS:
- Filename: ball.png
- Description: Pinball ball
- Size: 16x16 pixels
- Format: PNG with transparent background

AI GENERATION PROMPT:
"8-bit pixel art pinball ball, glowing cyan color (#43dde6), small circular shape with slight shine effect, on transparent background."

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
1. The ball should be a simple circular shape with a cyan glow effect
2. The core of the ball should be a lighter cyan (#43dde6) with a darker outline
3. A small white highlight should be added to give it a metallic/glass appearance
4. The background should be transparent to allow it to be placed on any surface
5. The final image should be saved as a PNG file with transparency

Once generated, this asset will be used in the game.js file to replace the current ball implementation:

```javascript
// Create ball
this.ball = Matter.Bodies.circle(
    this.width / 2, this.height / 4, 
    15, {
        restitution: 0.8, // Bounciness
        friction: 0.01,
        density: 0.05,
        render: {
            sprite: {
                texture: './assets/images/ball.png',
                xScale: 1,
                yScale: 1
            }
        }
    }
);
