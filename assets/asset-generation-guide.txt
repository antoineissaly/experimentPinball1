2. FLIPPERS (LEFT AND RIGHT)
Prompt: "8-bit pixel art pinball flippers, synthwave cyan color (#43dde6), simple triangular shape, on transparent background, sprite sheet showing different rotation angles."

3. BALL
Prompt: "8-bit pixel art pinball ball, glowing cyan color (#43dde6), small circular shape with slight shine effect, on transparent background."

4. ALIEN ENEMIES (VARIOUS TYPES)
Prompt: "8-bit pixel art space invader style alien sprites in synthwave colors (pink #e83283, purple #7b2cbf), 4 different alien designs, on transparent background, sprite sheet showing each alien in 2 animation frames."

5. BUMPERS
Prompt: "8-bit pixel art pinball bumpers shaped like small UFOs, synthwave purple color (#7b2cbf) with pink (#e83283) highlights, on transparent background."

6. TARGETS
Prompt: "8-bit pixel art pinball targets shaped like planets or asteroids, synthwave colors (mix of purple, pink, cyan), on transparent background, sprite sheet showing inactive and hit states."

7. RAMPS
Prompt: "8-bit pixel art pinball ramps in synthwave style, glowing pink color (#e83283), simple angular design, on transparent background."

8. MOTHERSHIP (MULTIBALL TRIGGER)
Prompt: "8-bit pixel art large alien mothership in synthwave colors (primarily purple #7b2cbf with pink #e83283 and cyan #43dde6 highlights), on transparent background, sprite sheet showing inactive, activating, and activated states."

10. UI ELEMENTS
Prompt: "8-bit pixel art UI elements for pinball game in synthwave style (purple, pink, cyan), including score display, life counter with small Earth icons, game over screen, and start button."

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- All assets should be created as PNG files with transparent backgrounds where appropriate
- Sprite sheets should be organized with clear spacing between frames
- Keep the pixel resolution consistent across assets (suggested 16x16 or 32x32 grid for smaller elements)
- Maintain the synthwave color palette for visual consistency
